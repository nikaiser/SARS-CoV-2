 Repo for all pandemic related design work

 ## History

 Originally forked from the [Scale Workspace](https://www.scaleworkspace.com/) repo for face shield design around V2.1.
Files have been reuploaded here for clarity as there were revisions that did not make sense in the original pull request.

 ## Face Shield Design

The intention of this shield is for every component to be autoclavable and reusable. The typical die cut PC shields, although by material definition can withstand autoclave temperatures, are susceptible to damage during assembly, wear, and disassembly. By reducing the number of folds in the fragile clear sheet, the design is not as prone to tearing during these steps.

### Materials

-Polypropylene (PP) Visor
-Polycarbonate (PC) Shield
-VMQ (silicone) Edging
-037 VMQ (silicone) O-ring, alt: hair tie, synthetic rubber band


Originally designed to be laser cut on a 150W CO2 Laser Cutter from [Black Cat Labs](https://www.blackcatlabs.xyz/), the Polypropylene consistently left large melt pools that were considered unacceptable by the end user. The rev2 designed has been optimized and nested for a CNC router using a 1/8" O Flute End Mill.
